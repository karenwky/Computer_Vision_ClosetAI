# Image Recognition: ClosetAI
Combining the techniques of Object Detection and Instance Segmentation, using Deep Learning model Mask R-CNN in Clothes Retrieval. Various medias such as clothing image and street fashion video can be analyzed by the model. Also, ClosetAI can generate business intelligence analysis in giving you a popular fashion items report.

## Data Source
[DeepFashion2 Dataset](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2/) which contains including 191,961 training images and 32,153 validation images. Json files of image information such as annotations and category names are also provided. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Preprocessing

## Deployment

## Skills Acquired
* Deep Learning: 
* Git LFS: upload large file greater than 100MB to GitHub using terminal command, self-written tutorial can be found [here](./Git_LFS.md)
