# Computer Vision: ClosetAI
Combining the techniques of Object Detection and Instance Segmentation, using deep learning model Mask R-CNN in clothes retrieval. Various medias such as clothing image and street fashion video can be analyzed by the model. Also, ClosetAI can generate business intelligence analysis in giving you a popular fashion items report.

## Data Source
[DeepFashion2 Dataset](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2/) which contains including 191,961 training images and 32,153 validation images. Json files of image information such as annotations and category names are also provided.

## Skills Acquired
* Deep Learning: Computer Vision
* Flask: deploy the machine learning model as a web application, classifying clothes in the uploaded image
* Git LFS: upload large file greater than 100MB to GitHub using terminal command, self-written tutorial can be found [here](./Git_LFS.md)
